# spm_container

This github repository contains a pipeline to interface with SPM12's segmentation and DARTEL tools in Octave and can be deployed on a high performance cluster.

This package depends on the [NeuroImaging Analysis Kit (NIAK) version 0.18.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/simexp/niak-boss/), which can be installed through a docker container. More information about the NIAK installation can be found [here](http://niak.simexp-lab.org/niak_installation.html).

This package also depends on SPM12. Visit the [SPM website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) for more info on their software and installation.
